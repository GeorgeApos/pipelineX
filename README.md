## Automated Machine Learning Pipeline for Software Experiments

**Note: This project is a part of my Master's Thesis, "Automated Machine Learning Pipeline for Software Experiments," supervised by Mr. Alexander Chatzigeorgiou.**

## Overview

Syntheci is an ongoing project aimed at automating the machine learning pipeline for software experiments. The goal is to streamline the process of applying machine learning techniques to software-related datasets. This repository contains the work in progress, and you can see the current progress and features.

## Features (Work in Progress)

- **Data Import:** Easily import your software experiment datasets in various formats.

- **Preprocessing:** Automate common data preprocessing tasks, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and encoding categorical variables.

- **Feature and Target Selection:** Intuitively select features and the target variable for your machine learning experiments.

- **Algorithm Recommendation:** Receive recommendations for the most suitable machine learning algorithm based on the dataset characteristics.

- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Train models and evaluate their performance on training and testing datasets.

- **Model Predictions:** Make predictions using trained models and assess their accuracy.

- **Model Saving:** Option to save the trained model for future use.
